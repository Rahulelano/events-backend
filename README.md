### Why you see "Cannot GET"
- The `/api/admin/login` endpoint is defined as a **POST** route in your backend:
  ```js
  router.post('/login', async (req, res) => { ... });
  ```
- If you visit `http://localhost:3001/api/admin/login` in your browser, your browser sends a **GET** request, but only POST is supported, so Express returns "Cannot GET /api/admin/login".

### This is **not** an error if:
- You are seeing this only when visiting the URL directly in your browser.
- Your frontend is making a POST request to `/api/admin/login` for login.

### What to do:
- **Do not** visit `/api/admin/login` directly in your browser.
- Use your frontend login form to POST credentials to this endpoint.

---

### If you are still getting 401 on login:
- Please provide the backend logs from the terminal after a login attempt (with the debug lines we added).
- Double-check your admin user in the database matches the credentials you are entering.

---

**Summary:**  
"Cannot GET" is normal if you visit a POST-only API route in your browser.  
Focus on the login flow from your frontend and backend logs for further debugging.

If you still have issues logging in, please provide the backend log output after a login attempt!
